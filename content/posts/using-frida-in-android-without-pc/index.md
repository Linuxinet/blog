In this tuorial we will see how to use Frida gadget on rooted android device without pc/laptop

___
## What is Frida?

itâ€™s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript or your own library into native apps on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX. Frida also provides you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API. These can be used as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to use the API.

## Usage
Typically pc/laptop is used to interact with android apps via adb. Now we can use only rooted device and do interact with applications in that mobile.

### Prerequisites: 
    1. Rooted Device
    2. Termux with python pre-installed
    3. Common sense

## Instructions 
First of all install Frida with pip, for other ways [click here](https://github.com/frida/frida/#two-ways-to-install)
```
pip install frida-tools
```
Now download latest Frida-server android binary from the frida github [Link](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/).
```
wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/15.2.2/frida-server-15.2.2-android-arm64.xz
```
extract the file
```
xz -d frida-server-15.2.2-android-arm64.xz
```
now move that binary file to `/data/local/tmp/` folder by using termux or any root file explorer.
```
sudo mv frida-server-15.2.2-android-arm64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
```
> here i used sudo to move the file to `/data/local/tmp`.
> so make sure you already have sudo in termux, otherwise install sudo with this command
> `pkg install tsu`

now change to root user in termux 
```
su
```
change to the **Frida-server** binary location i.e, `/data/local/tmp/frida-server`
```
cd /data/local/tmp/
```
give permission to that binary
```
chmod 777 frida-server
```
![image](images/root-su-data-local.png)
now run frida-server listening on localhost as root user 
```
./frida-server -l 127.0.0.1:1234
```
now open another tab and use frida cli tools we installed previously
